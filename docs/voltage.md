# Voltage

- **Starting pool:** Runs begin at 10,000 volts.
- **Star penalties:** Each star you miss when submitting a challenge costs 1,000 volts (e.g., a 5-star song drops 1,000; a 0-star song drops 6,000).
- **Floor only:** Voltage cannot go below zero; recovery hooks will come later.
- **Visibility:** The React client shows current voltage in the header and autosaves it with the rest of the run state.
